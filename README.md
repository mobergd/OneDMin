# Functionality 
Lennard-Jones parameters are calculated from full-dimensional intermolecular potentials via one-dimensional minimizations averaged over the colliding partners' relative orientations. This method includes the effect of local anisotropy in the interaction potential and was shown to lead to very accurate predictions of Lennard-Jones collision rates as compared with tabulated values and with higher-level classical diffusion coefficients.
